[Classification 31: White Slave Traffic Act](https://www.archives.gov/research/investigations/fbi/classifications/031-white-slave-traffic.html) Investigation of white slave traffic is one of the oldest functions of the Bureau, dating from the passage of the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act) in 1910. Originally established as a separate records system, the white slave traffic act cases were incorporated into the central filing system that the Bureau adopted from the Justice Department in 1921. The act was codified in U.S. Code Title 18 and prohibited transportation of women or girls in interstate or foreign commerce for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or other immoral purposes, the coercion or enticement of women or girls for this purpose, and the coercion or enticement of female minors.


[The Mann Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act), previously called the [White-Slave Traffic Act of 1910](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/25/this-day-in-politics-june-25-1910-663071), is a United States federal law, passed June 25, 1910 (ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825; codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421–2424). It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois.

[Divide and Conquer](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._War_Department_-_Divide_and_Conquer_(1943).webm)

Divide and rule policy (Latin: divide et impera), or divide and conquer, in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power divisively. This includes the exploitation of existing divisions within a political group by its political opponents, and also the deliberate creation or strengthening of such divisions.

The strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of Aulus Gabinius exists, parting the Jewish nation into five conventions, reported by Flavius Josephus in Book I, 169–170 of The Jewish War (De bello Judaico).[1] Strabo also reports in Geographica, 8.7.3[2] that the Achaean League was gradually dissolved when it became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, as the Romans treated the various states differently, wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.[citation needed]

Elements of this technique involve: [citation needed]

creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign and distributing forces so that they overpower each other.
aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign
fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers
encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending [Read<oreOnWikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule) [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173769/)

[Frank Lloyd Wright Sr.](https://franklloydwright.org/) (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator. He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship.[1][2] Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture.
